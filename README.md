### Context:
[//]: <> I had a little over a week to complete this project and I am currently in Mod 2.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> https://github.com/bwillett2003 https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan--willett/

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The learning goals for this project were: Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP. Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM. Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM. Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps. The only tech I used during this project was VSCode, Github, Slack, and ChatGPT.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> It has functionality! That is always a win. I added an alert to the create poster field that pops up a message to fill out all fields before submitting. Simple but really fun and helpful. The challenges were dealing with saving and deleting posters. I overcame this by just researching different ways to eventually find a solution.
